        <h2>History of Waste</h2>
        <p>In the United States, the generation of waste increased from 88.1 million tons in 1960 to 292.4 million tons in 2018. In 1960, the generation rate was just 2.68 pounds per person per day. In 1980, it increased to 3.66 pounds per person per day. Then in 2000, it reached 4.74 pounds per person per day, and then decreased to 4.69 pounds per person per day in 2005. In 2018, the generation rate was 4.9 pounds per person per day, an 8% increase from 2017. Despite the massive increase, landfilling of waste has decreased from 94% of the amount generated in 1960 to 50% of the amount generated in 2018. This is a direct result of increased recycling rates.</p>
